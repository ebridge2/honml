# SVG grabber

This is a utility function which pulls the `svg` files into a directory. It is useful given the compiled raw `svg` files for the textbook figures (produced by running all the individual notebooks [here](https://github.com/ebridge2/textbook_figs/tree/main/textbook)), and then pulling all of them into a separate directory for distribution to Cambridge University Press.

This project is an addition for a forthcoming work, to be published with Cambridge University Press (2025), entitled "Hands-On Network Machine Learning with Python".

The project is organized as follows. Each chapter/section in the book corresponds to a chapter/section in this project. Section-level notebooks contain the code to reproduce all figures in the book, save minor modifications made in illustrator. Additionally, each chapter contains a single notebook, entitled "Code Reproducibility". This corresponds to the code in the book, as-written, for reproduction purposes. 

Details for deploying a jupyter server to run the code in the notebooks on your local machine can be found at [the README.md for this project's repository](https://github.com/ebridge2/honml).

This material has been / will be published by Cambridge University Press as Hands-On Network Machine Learning by Eric W. Bridgeford, Alex Loftus, and Joshua T. Vogelstein.
